Request of csv data formatting. 
Last updated: 10/27/23 Liao Zhu

- Add two new columns: Semester, Year (I did this for the three files)
- Seperate Course section from Course subject number
- Most sections only contain TA names, would be nice to have real professor names as well
- Some sections have no primary instructor names at all: instead of being blank replace with N/A

TLDR:
1. **Column Headers** (ideally): COURSE_NUMBER, COURSE_SECTION, COURSE_TITLE, COURSE_INSTRUCTOR (professor not TA), SEMESTER, YEAR, A_PLUS, A, A_MINUS, ..., F, W
2. **Row Data**: COURSE_INSTRUCTOR should be professors if possible, if COURSE_INSTRUCTOR is blank or not given fill with N/A 

Check Fall_2022.csv under data/ for an example of how to structure the csv data.
